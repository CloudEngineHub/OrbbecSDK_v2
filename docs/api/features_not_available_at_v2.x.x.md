# Features not available in the current version

## Record playback

The record playback feature will soon be redesigned in a future version

## Firmware upgrade and OrbbecViewer OTA function

It will be added in the upcoming version. Current users need to use the old version of the SDK and tools to upgrade the firmware.

## Mirror/Flip/Rotate frames inside SDK or device
The SDK will no longer support outputting data frames after mirror/flip/rotate processing, but users can freely handle this in their application code by calling the frame processing filter.
