## 1. Introduction

This is the open source library of the Orbbec SDK v2.x. The Orbbec SDK is a cross-platform library for interfacing with the Orbbec RGB-D cameras. It provides C/C++ APIs and many other languages or frameworks [wrappers](wrappers/README.md).

<div align=center>
<img src="docs/resource/Overview.jpg" width="400" align="center" />
</div>

To enhance performance and accommodate the diverse needs of our customers, the Orbbec SDK has been open source since version 2.0.0. For projects currently utilizing version Orbbec SDK v1.x that are considering an upgrade to Orbbec SDK v2.x, we advise using the pre-compiled binaries available in the [Release](https://github.com/orbbec/OrbbecSDK_v2/releases) page. This ensures a seamless transition and maintains consistency with your existing setup.

We have made every effort to maintain backward compatibility with our APIs. However, in pursuit of enhanced performance and an improved user experience, we have made necessary updates. Some interfaces have been removed or altered due to infrequent use or design imperfections. These changes are intended to be minimally disruptive and should not interfere with the standard functionality of the SDK.

For a detailed list of features not available in the current version, please refer to our documentation: [features_not_available_at_v2.x.x](docs/api/features_not_available_at_v2.x.x.md).

Additionally, a comprehensive overview of the API changes from Orbbec SDK v1.x to v2.x.x can be found here: [api_changes_at_v2.x.x](docs/api/api_changes_at_v2.x.x.md).

If you prefer to continue with Orbbec SDK v1.x, you can still access the pre-compiled binaries on our [Orbbec SDK](https://github.com/orbbec/OrbbecSDK) repository. Nonetheless, we encourage you to consider transitioning to Orbbec SDK v2.x. This move will allow you to take advantage of  improved and new features and ensure ongoing support. Our dedication to v2.x is part of a broader strategy aimed at delivering robust long-term support, fostering an open-source community, and driving innovation.

## 2. Documentation

*The Orbbec SDK documentation is available on [GitHub Pages](https://orbbec.github.io/OrbbecSDK_v2/).*

### 2.1 Environment Setup

#### windows

For windows, you need to register the metadata associated with frames (this includes things like timestamps and other information about the video frame).

- Metadata registration follow this:[/scripts/env_setup/obsensor_metadata_win10.md](scripts/env_setup/obsensor_metadata_win10.md)

*Notes: If the metadata is not registered, the device timestamp will be abnormal, thereby affecting the SDKâ€™s internal frame synchronization functionality.*

#### Linux

For Linux, we have provided a script to help you set up the environment. You can run the script as follows:

```bash
cd scripts/env_setup
  sudo chmod +x ./install_udev_rules.sh
  sudo ./install_udev_rules.sh
  sudo udevadm control --reload && sudo udevadm trigger
```

*Notes: If this script is not executed, open the device will fail due to permission issues. You need to run the sample with sudo (administrator privileges).*


### 2.2 How to Use install package
If you do not want to compile the Orbbec SDK, you can use the SDK installation package. First [download the corresponding installation package](https://github.com/orbbec/OrbbecSDK_v2/releases) for your platform.

1. The file `OrbbecSDK_vx.x.x_win64.exe` serves as the installation package for the Orbbec SDK and Orbbec Viewer tools on Windows.
2. The file `OrbbecSDK_vx.x.x_amd64.deb` serves as the installation package for the Orbbec SDK and Orbbec Viewer tools on Linux x86_64, likes ubuntu.
3. The file `OrbbecSDK_vx.x.x_arm64.deb` serves as the installation package for the Orbbec SDK and Orbbec Viewer tools on ARM64ï¼Œlikes  NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin , NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX , NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano , NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier , NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX.

#### Linux Install via .deb Package
- On the Linux x64 (ubuntu) platform, install using the following command. (If you are using the Arm64 platform, please use `OrbbecSDK_vx.x.x_arm64.deb`)
~~~
sudo dpkg -i OrbbecSDK_v2.x.x_amd64.deb
~~~

- Check the entire package path of the Orbbec SDK using dpkg -L orbbecsdk, while the header files and library files of the Orbbec SDK will be installed in the /usr/local path.
~~~
dpkg -L orbbecsdk
~~~

- Run the Orbbec Viewer.
~~~
sudo ./OrbbecViewer
~~~

#### Windows Install via .exe Package
On the windows platform, Double-click OrbbecSDK_vx.x.x_win64.exe directly to install, After installation is complete, run OrbbecViewer or the Orbbec SDK from the installation directory.

### 2.3 Quick Start

### 3.1 The QuickStart Example

```c++
// Create a pipeline.
ob::Pipeline pipe;

// Start the pipeline with default config.
pipe.start();

// Create a window for showing the frames, and set the size of the window.
ob_smpl::CVWindow win("QuickStart", 1280, 720, ob_smpl::ARRANGE_ONE_ROW);

while(win.run()) {
    // Wait for frameSet from the pipeline, the default timeout is 1000ms.
    auto frameSet = pipe.waitForFrameset();

    // Push the frames to the window for showing.
    win.pushFramesToView(frameSet);
}

// Stop the Pipeline, no frame data will be generated
pipe.stop();
```

### 3.2 The Orbbec Viewer

![Orbbec Viewer](docs/resource/OrbbecViewer.jpg)
- Notes

If the Orbbec Viewer is used under Linux OS and is used for updating any camera firmware, users may encounter the issue that the firmware file selection window is not poping up. Users are unable to proceed with the firmware update work flow and are unable to update the camera firmware.

- Solution:
1. Exit the Orbbec Viewer under Linux OS .
2. Run the following command as root in a terminal for installing the necessary tool Zenity.
```
sudo apt-get install zenity
```

3. Start the Orbbec Viewer under Linux OS and proceed with the firmware update work flow.
