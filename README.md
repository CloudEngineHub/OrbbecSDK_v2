### 4.1 Running the QuickStart Example
Code snippet of the QuickStart example:
```c++
// Create a pipeline.
ob::Pipeline pipe;

// Start the pipeline with default config.
pipe.start();

// Create a window for showing the frames, and set the size of the window.
ob_smpl::CVWindow win("QuickStart", 1280, 720, ob_smpl::ARRANGE_ONE_ROW);

while(win.run()) {
    // Wait for frameSet from the pipeline, the default timeout is 1000ms.
    auto frameSet = pipe.waitForFrameset();

    // Push the frames to the window for showing.
    win.pushFramesToView(frameSet);
}

// Stop the Pipeline, no frame data will be generated
pipe.stop();
```
